- Allow Expectation.extend to work on instances instead of instantiable (!?) 
  objects [Michael Shuerig]
- Allow something.should have(N, "elements"). If something.elements doesn't exist, 
  then it assumes something is an enumerable and calles size/gets length of it to 
  compare with N [foca]
- Fixed rake's task to include matchers in the source when building a package [foca]

[0.2.2]

- Fixed (1).should(be(1)) to check if both are numbers, then return x == y, else x === y
  and patched Object.isNumber to check for instanceof if typeof doesn't work [foca]
- ...I should've started keeping this long ago :-)
